# üõ°Ô∏è Hedge Anything

**A sophisticated financial tool for hedging everyday expense volatility using Polymarket prediction markets.**

Transform unpredictable costs into manageable risks with precise hedging calculations, Monte Carlo simulations, and risk-optimized strategies.

## Features

- **Precise Hedging Calculator** - Calculate exact Polymarket positions for expense protection
- **Monte Carlo Risk Engine** - 5,000+ simulation runs with comprehensive risk metrics  
- **Intelligent Optimization** - AI-powered hedge ratio optimization for maximum downside protection
- **Advanced Analytics** - VaR, volatility reduction, Sharpe ratios, and comparative analysis
- **Educational Framework** - Learn proper hedging mindset (insurance vs speculation)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install and run
npm install
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000

# Test
npm test

# Build
npm run build
```

## How It Works

1. **Configure Your Scenario** - Enter baseline vs adverse expense amounts
2. **Set Market Parameters** - Input Polymarket YES price and desired hedge coverage
3. **Analyze Risk Profile** - View Monte Carlo simulations and optimization results
4. **Execute Strategy** - Get precise share calculations and Polymarket deep-links

## Example Use Case

**Gas Price Hedging**: Normally spend $150/month, but could spend $300 if oil spikes. Use Polymarket contract "Oil >$80 by Dec 2024" at 25¬¢ to hedge 80% of the $150 additional risk over 12 months.

**Result**: Buy ~121 shares for ~$30 premium, reducing worst-case from -$300 to -$208/month.

## Technology

- **Next.js 15** with TypeScript and App Router
